    # Optional: If you have any specific API proxying needs for the frontend,
    # you could add them here, but for now, the frontend directly calls the backend.
    # For example, if you wanted to proxy API calls through Nginx:
    # location /api/ {
    #     proxy_pass http://card-catalog-service:5000; # Proxy to your backend service
    #     proxy_set_header Host $host;
    #     proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    #     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    #     proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    # }
